# MapImageObjects

You can finally add images from the web to your maps! Images can be placed and configured extensively in the editor with the editor mod (MapImageObjectsEditor).

## Features

- Collision
- Editor Tools
- Shadows
- Lots of object properties!

## Installation

The mods will automatically install in the [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/) mod manager.

There are two mods: One for map-makers and one for users. (If you are a map-maker, you will need both). Both mods can be found in the releases on the [GitHub](https://github.com/Woukie/MapImageObjects).

If you do install manually, make sure to also install the related dependencies depending on which one you go for:

#### MapImageObjects
- unbound
- mapsextended

#### MapImageObjectsEditor
- unbound
- mapimageobjects
- mapsextended
- mapsextended.editor
